{"chat_history": [{"inputs": {"question": "What is the Big Bang Theory?"}, "outputs": {"answer": "The Big Bang Theory is a widely accepted cosmological model that explains the observable universe's origin and development. It proposes that the universe began as a hot, dense point approximately 13.8 billion years ago and has been expanding ever since."}}], "question": "What is the evidence supporting this theory?", "ground_truth": "The Big Bang Theory is supported by various pieces of evidence, including the cosmic microwave background radiation, the abundance of light elements in the universe, and the large-scale structure of the cosmos."}
{"chat_history": [{"inputs": {"question": "Who is Marie Curie?"}, "outputs": {"answer": "Marie Curie was a pioneering physicist and chemist known for her groundbreaking research on radioactivity. She was the first woman to win a Nobel Prize and remains the only person to have won Nobel Prizes in two different scientific fields."}}], "question": "What were Marie Curie's major contributions to science?", "ground_truth": "Marie Curie's discoveries laid the groundwork for many developments in physics and chemistry. She coined the term 'radioactivity' and discovered the elements polonium and radium."}
{"chat_history": [{"inputs": {"question": "What is Climate Change?"}, "outputs": {"answer": "Climate change refers to long-term shifts in temperature, precipitation, and other atmospheric conditions on Earth. It is primarily driven by human activities such as burning fossil fuels, deforestation, and industrial processes."}}], "question": "What are the consequences of climate change?", "ground_truth": "Climate change poses significant challenges, including rising global temperatures, sea level rise, extreme weather events, and disruptions to ecosystems and biodiversity. Addressing climate change requires collective action at local, national, and international levels."}
{"chat_history": [{"inputs": {"question": "What is the Theory of Evolution?"}, "outputs": {"answer": "The Theory of Evolution, proposed by Charles Darwin, explains how species evolve over time through natural selection. It suggests that organisms with favorable traits are more likely to survive and reproduce, leading to changes in populations over successive generations."}}], "question": "How does the Theory of Evolution explain biodiversity?", "ground_truth": "The Theory of Evolution provides a framework for understanding the diversity of life on Earth. It has withstood scientific scrutiny and is supported by a vast body of evidence from various fields such as genetics, paleontology, and comparative anatomy."}
{"chat_history": [{"inputs": {"question": "What is Quantum Mechanics?"}, "outputs": {"answer": "Quantum mechanics is the branch of physics that describes the behavior of particles at the smallest scales, such as atoms and subatomic particles. It is characterized by phenomena such as wave-particle duality, superposition, and entanglement."}}], "question": "What are the practical applications of Quantum Mechanics?", "ground_truth": "Quantum mechanics revolutionized our understanding of the microscopic world and laid the foundation for modern technologies such as semiconductors, lasers, and quantum computing."}
